/**
 * What is exception handling and what problem does it solve?
 * > Exception handling tries to anticipate errors that might occur in the try block,
 * and handles them accordingly. This solves the problem of running into bugs that might
 * otherwise cause the program to fail completely, and to handle these edge scenarios
 * instead.
